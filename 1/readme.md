The Pro version was deleted 03.10.2024

The Pro version is almost 3 times faster than the Lite on a base dataset size of 50k. With the increase in the size of the dataset, the speed advantage of the pro version is becoming more and more, for example, by 4 times for 500k. The pro version is able to work with very large sizes by saving the dataset in .parquet format, while the lite saves json xlsx and even 1kk does not fit into RAM anymore
